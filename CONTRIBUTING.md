### Building and Running
- In order to build project use `gradle build` command in the root project directory.
- To run server module use `gradle run` command.
- To run client module with npm server enter `client` directory and use `npm start` command. Notice that you should build this module before running npm server, because Kotlin files needed to be compiled to JS first.

### Guidelines
There is no specific guidelines yet. Just make it work!
